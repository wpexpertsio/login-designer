Login Designer is the most versatile login page customizer plugin for WordPress with options to customize the style of the login page layout to the last detail. Your website visitors will feel like the page is custom-made from scratch.

Save yourself time and effort by choosing from predefined templates that come with ready-made layouts and customization options for colors, images, fonts, labels, and other details. The process is quick, easy, and fun - User-friendly for both beginners and advanced users.

Every design you create and publish will be responsive and compatible with web browsers and mobile devices - That's the true power of Login Designer.

= Why Choose Login Designer? =
You shouldn't have to hire a developer to customize your website's login page. That's why we built Login Designer, the best login customizer plugin for WordPress. This plugin offers customization options ranging from background animations, fonts, colors, gradients, labels, styles and so much more. Give your customers an unrivaled live-editing experience unlike any other.

= An Unparalleled Custom Login Styling Experience =

Zero refreshes. Contextually displayed options and plugin settings. Custom event triggers. Context-aware previews. Powerful custom controls. Live editing... the list goes on.

= Login Designer is a UX beast =

It's familiar, yet completely revolutionary. Click on _any element_ from your login page to fine-tune it. That element's settings are contextually displayed, while others hide. This way, you'll spend less time navigating the Customizer's sections and panels, and more time actually fine-tuning your website's login page. #winning
