Login Designer is the best way to style a custom login page for your WordPress login, register and forgot password forms, right from the live-action WordPress Customizer.

== Description ==

You shouldn’t have to hire a developer to customize your website's login page. That’s why I built Login Designer, the best login customizer plugin for WordPress.

While Login Designer is not the first WordPress plugin designed for styling custom login pages, it offers an unrivaled live-editing experience unlike any other.

**Login Designer’s login customizing and templating experience is the best in class — _by a long shot_**.

= An unparalleled custom login styling experience =

Zero refreshes. Contextually displayed options and plugin settings. Custom event triggers. Context-aware previews. Powerful custom controls. Live editing... the list goes on.

Login Designer is a UX beast.

It’s familiar, yet completely revolutionary. Click on _any element_ from your login page to fine tune it. That element’s settings are contextually displayed, while other’s hide. This way, you'll spend less time navigating the Customizer’s sections and panels, and more time actually fine-tuning your website's login page. #winning
