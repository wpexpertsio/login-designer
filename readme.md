While [Login Designer](https://logindesigner.com?utm_medium=login-designer-github&utm_source=readme&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=login-designer) is not the first WordPress plugin designed for custom login editing, it offers an unrivaled live-editing experience unlike any other. I'm talking zero refreshes. Contextually displayed options and plugin settings. Custom event triggers. Context-aware previews. Powerful custom controls. Live editing… the list goes on.

Login Designer is a UX beast. Click below to see a quick video.
